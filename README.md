# NTU-SC1015-Mini-Project
This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, images, video presentations, and the source materials/references we have used and created as part of the Mini Project for SC1015: Introduction to Data Science and AI.
# Problem Definition
# Dataset Explored 
The dataset used for this project is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/ideal-student-life-survey/).

We cleaned and prepared the dataset for EDA and Machine Learning separately hence, there is no "cleaned dataset". Refer to respective notebook to see how we cleaned and prepared the dataset for each use.

# Brief Summary
# Conclusion
•    Unable to achieve our objective of reducing stress level and increasing student satisfaction.
•    However, we were able to successfully identify the 5 top factors for stress level and student satisfaction respectively.
•    Interestingly, stress and satisfaction are closely linked but it is unclear if the relationship is positive or negative.
•    According to our feature importance analysis, student volunteering in events have high influence in both stress and student satisfaction.
•    Based on our findings, we would like to suggest to universities to provide opportunities to cater to a broader range of students, allowing them to engage in events they are passionate about.
