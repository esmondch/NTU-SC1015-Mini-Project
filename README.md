# NTU-SC1015-Mini-Project
This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, images, video presentations, and the source materials/references we have used and created as part of the Mini Project for SC1015: Introduction to Data Science and AI.
# Problem Definition
# Dataset Explored 
The dataset used for this project is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/ideal-student-life-survey/).
We cleaned and prepared the dataset for EDA and Machine Learning separately hence, there is no "cleaned dataset". Refer to respective notebook to see how we cleaned and prepared the dataset for each use.
